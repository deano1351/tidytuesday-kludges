The data comes from the [#TidyTuesday dataset on Bob Ross paintings](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2019/2019-08-06).

First, a word cloud of the most frequently used themes/items in the paintings:

<!--more-->

Next, we can see a heatmap showing his use of these elements accross the seasons:

Finally, we will do a (hopefully) artistic looking circular barchart of the element's frequencies:

![Is it a palette? or is it a circular barchart?](/tidytuesday-kludges/assets/2019-08-06-bob-ross-paintings/circular-barchart-elements.png)

Sort-of, kind-of, looks like a painter's palette :smiley:
