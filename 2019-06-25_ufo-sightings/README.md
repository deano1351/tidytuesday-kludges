- Had to make several GIF files, otherwise my computer couldn't finish processing
- The big GIF was made using `gifsicle`

```
$ gifsicle animation_* --colors 256 > animation-ufo-sightings_1910-2014.gif
```

- The small multiples plot is so I had something to put on a tweet (the animations didn't load on Twitter)
