Note to self: check the equations at https://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq5.html#nfaq5.1

- Convert yields to multiples (or fractions) of 2.5kt (Y), so radii will be in km

r_thermal = Y^0.41
r_blast = Y^0.33
r_radiation = Y^0.19

If not scaled, for a 20psi pressure front (fatalities ~ 100%)

r_blast = 0.28 * Y^0.33  (Y in kt, r_blast in km)

And for thermal (3rd degree burns)

r_thermal = 0.67 * Y^0.41 (accurate to ~10% from 1kt to 20Mt)
